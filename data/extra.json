	"problem": ["One day, while walking home from work, the devil pays you a visit. He has a proposition, and afraid to insult him, you agree to listen.","","\"I have two 100 dollar bills, and I am going to give both of them to you\", says Lucifer with a sly grin. \"Then I am going to make a statement. If the statement is false, then you give me back just one of the 100 dollar bills. If the statement is true, then you keep them both. Do we have a deal?\"","","Seeing nothing but profit in the proposal, you agree to the deal, and shake hands with the devil. Satan hands you two crisp 100 dollar bills and makes his statement.","","After he does, you owe the devil one million dollars. What did he say?"],
	"solution": ["\"You will either give me one of those 100 dollar bills or you will give me one million dollars.\"","Now, you're trapped by logic. If you were to give the devil one of the 100 dollar bills, you would make the statement true. But, by doing so, you would violate the initial conditions of the agreement. Remember, the devil said, \"If the statement is true, then you keep them both.\" This is a deal with the devil, so the phrasing of the initial agreement is binding.","","You might be thinking that you can give the devil a different amount, like $110 for example. This would make the statement false, allowing you to give him back one of the $100 bills without violating the agreement. But remember, he said, \"If the statement is false, then you give me back just one of the 100 dollar bills.\"","","The genius of Satan's play here is that he takes a scenario that appears to have two choices and twists it so that only one of them adheres to the rules of the game, leaving you only one choice. You cannot give him a $100 bill without violating the first part of the agreement, and you cannot give him any amount other than $100 or $1,000,000 without violating the second part of the agreement. Therefore you have but one option: Pay the devil one million dollars."],

Eve uses rock twice, scissors four times, and paper four times.","3.There are no ties in all 10 games, and the order of games is unknown","","Who wins? By how much?"],
	"solution": ["The key to solving this riddle is realizing that Adam played scissors six times. Because there were no ties, that means Eve didn't play scissors in any of those six games. Now look at the various hands Eve did play. Because she played scissors four times, and none of those could line up with one of the six times Adam played scissors, she must have played all six of her other hands on Adam's six scissors. Tally it all up, and Adam wins, 7 to 3."],

	"problem": ["A businessman, for personal reasons of his own, needs to gain access to a notorious but elusive thieves guild. After snooping around the city for a few days, he finally gets a tip about the location of the guild entrance down a dark alleyway.","","After observing the entrance for about an hour, the businessman notices that the thieves seem to have some sort of passcode system using numbers. When someone approaches the door, they are given a number, and then they reply with a number.","","The first person steps up, and the guard tells them \"twelve,\" to which they respond \"six.\" The person is admitted. A second person approaches the door, and the guard tells them \"six,\" to which they reply \"three.\" The second person is also admitted.","","Convinced that he has cracked the code, the businessman approaches the door to the thieves guild, and the guard tells him \"ten,\" to which he confidently replies \"five.\" The guard immediately slams the door in the businessman's face, and a deadbolt slots into place.","","What should the businessman have said?"],
	"solution": ["The businessman should have said \"three,\" the number of letters in \"ten.\" Similarly, \"twelve\" has six letters, and \"six\" has three letters, the answers the first two thieves gave."],

	"solution": ["Take sample from Chest 3. Since all of them are labeled incorrectly, there are two possibilities. Chest 3 can either have 100 gold coins OR 100 copper coins. If the sample you take from chest 3 is a gold coin, then you hit the jackpot. If the sample is copper, since chest 1 is NOT the 100 gold chest, then the 100 gold coins must be in chest 2."],

The same logic goes for 9-8.","","In 3-4 scenario, Student-B's number is either 2 or 4. If Student-B's number is 2, Student-A's number must either be 1 or 3. If Student-A is unsure of Student-B's number, Student-B should know that Student-A's number is 3.
