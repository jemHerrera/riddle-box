	"solution": ["There are two wrong statements in the list above. The third statement contradicts itself, making it a wrong statement. First statement says that there is exactly one wrong statement in the list, meaning the other two must be correct statements. But since all the statements say \"exactly\", only one of these statements can be correct, thus making statement two correct."],

If the sample you take from chest 3 is a gold coin, then you hit the jackpot. If the sample is copper, since chest 1 is NOT the 100 gold chest, then the 100 gold coins must be in chest 2."],
