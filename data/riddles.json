First statement says that there is exactly one wrong statement in the list, meaning the other two must be correct statements.

The crossing takes exactly seven days and seven nights in either direction. How many other ocean liners will an ocean liner leaving Le Havre today pass at sea before arriving in New York?","","If you're wondering whether a ship casting off from harbor just as another arrives counts as a \"pass at sea,\" yes, the solution does count these encounters."],
	"solution": ["The answer is 15 ocean liners. When one sets sail from Le Havre, there are 6 other ocean liners already at sea that set out from New York. In addition to these, 7 more ocean liners will leave New York during the voyage, including the ship that leaves simultaneously from New York as our ship casts off from Le Havre. So a ship leaving Le Havre \"today\" will see 13 other ships in the ocean. In addition to these, it will cross paths with another ship as it casts off from Le Havre, and yet another as soon as it arrives in New York, adding 2 more. An ocean liner leaving Le Havre on any given day will pass 15 other ocean liners on its way to New York."],

	"solution": ["The key to solving this riddle is realizing that Adam played scissors six times. Because there were no ties, that means Eve didn't play scissors in any of those six games. Now look at the various hands Eve did play. Because she played scissors four times, and none of those could line up with one of the six times Adam played scissors, she must have played all six of her other hands on Adam's six scissors.
