In addition to these, 7 more ocean liners will leave New York during the voyage, including the ship that leaves simultaneously from New York as our ship casts off from Le Havre.

If you were to give the devil one of the 100 dollar bills, you would make the statement true. But, by doing so, you would violate the initial conditions of the agreement. Remember, the devil said, \"If the statement is true, then you keep them both.\" This is a deal with the devil, so the phrasing of the initial agreement is binding.","","You might be thinking that you can give the devil a different amount, like $110 for example.

But remember, he said, \"If the statement is false, then you give me back just one of the 100 dollar bills.\"","","The genius of Satan's play here is that he takes a scenario that appears to have two choices and twists it so that only one of them adheres to the rules of the game, leaving you only one choice. You cannot give him a $100 bill without violating the first part of the agreement, and you cannot give him any amount other than $100 or $1,000,000 without violating the second part of the agreement.
